We kindly ask that contributors:
* Do **not** submit a language that already exists.
  * In the case where a bad/faulty translation of your chosen language already exists, we ask you to amend the current existing one, rather than adding another duplicate language.
* Do **not** submit a made-up/joke language.
* Do **not** remove contributers from the contributors file.
* Only edit one language at a time

__Please follow these rules, as well as the guidelines in the Pull Request template when contributing to this repo__
