## From local editor:   
1. Create fork of this repository
    * Scroll to the top of this page and click 'Fork'. Doing so will add a copy of this repo to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository
    * Log into your GitHub account in GitHub Desktop. On the home screen, you will see a list of your repositories. Select the forked repo, and then click `Clone <yourusername>/SCPSL-Translations` - doing so will download the repo onto your computer. If you are using Git Bash or a similar CLI client, refer to [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo). 
3. Open a file and edit/add what you want to change with a text editor
4. Once all desired changes have been made, run `EncodingNormalizer.exe` on the modified files
    * `EncodingNormalizer.exe` is an application which ensures correct encoding and formatting of translation files. **Please use this before submitting your Pull Request.**
    * `EncodingNormalizer.exe` only needs to be run on the files that have been modified. These files can be selected by clicking 'Choose File' and selecting the desired file(s) or directory.
5. Commit the modified files
   * Please include a meaningful commit describing exact changes that were made. This is helpful to us when reviewing Pull Requests and commit history.
    * __Only__ commit changes to files you've added/edited. **Don't** commit changes to `English (default)`
   - Usually most GUI clients, such as GitHub desktop will only commit modified files. 
6. Push your commit(s) to GitHub
    * When changes are committed, only the files on disk (i.e. in the *cloned* repo) are modified. By pushing these commits, these changes are also reflected in the forked repository on GitHub. This is necessary for the next step:
7. Open a Pull Request (see below). Studio staff will review the translation.
## From GitHub:
1. Open a desired file and click "Edit this file".
   - This will automatically create a fork of this repo to your account. Any changes made to files will only be reflected in the forked repo. Learn more about forking on GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-forks)
2. Make any desired changes. 
3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message.
   * Please include a meaningful commit message describing the exact changes that were made. This is helpful to us when reviewing Pull Requests and commit history.
    * __Only__ commit changes to files you've edited. **Don't** commit changes to `English (default)`
4. Open a Pull Request (see below). Studio Staff will review the translation.
